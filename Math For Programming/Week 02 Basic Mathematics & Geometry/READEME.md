# GCD - Greatest Common Divisior

- Divisor
- Common divisor
- Greatest common divisor
- Example: Find the gcd of 15 & 16
	- Divisors of 15: 1, 3, 5, 15
	- Divisors of 16: 1, 2, 3, 6
	- Common divisors: 1, 3
	- GCD (Great Common Divisor): 3

- Co-prime: If gcd(a, b) = 1, then a & b are co-prime
- Example: 15 & 16 are co-prime
	- Example: 8 & 15

# GCD - How To Calculate?

- Simple way to find gcd(a,b)
	- Take i to be 1 to min(a,b)
	- Check if i divides both a & b
	- Largest such i is the gcd

# GCD - The Euclidean Algorithm

- gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a mod b)
or, gcd(a, b) = gcd(b, a % b)
- gcd(p, 0) = gcd(0, p) = p
- Example: 
	   gcd(15,6)      //**gcd(a, b)**
	 = gcd(6, 3)     //**gcd(b, a % b)**
	 = gcd(3, 0)    //**gcd(p, 0)**
	 = 3

- Changing order does not matter
	- gcd(6,15) = gcd(15,6) = ... = 3

- gcd(15,8) = gcd(8,7) = gcd(7,1) = gcd(1,0) = 1 ‚û°Ô∏è Co-prime

# LCM - Least Common Multiple

- Multiple
- Common multiple
- Least common multiple
- Example: Find the lcm of 15 & 6
	- Multiples of 15: 15, 30, 45, 60,...
	- Multiples of 6: 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54, 60,...
	- Common multiples: 30, 60,...
	- LCM (Least Common Multiple): 30

# LCM - How To Calculate?

- Simple way to find lcm(a,b)
	- Take multiples of the larger number and see if the smaller number divides it

- Or you may find it using gcd:
	```math
	gcd(a, b) * lcm(a, b) = a * b
	```
	-Example: lcm(15,6) = 15 * 6 / 3 = 30

# Factorial

- A function defined for non-negative integers
     - 0,1,2,3,......
```math
n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * (n-3) * .... * 3 * 2 * 1
```
- Example: 4! = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 24
- Exception: 0! = 1

```
- 5! = 120 ‚û°Ô∏è divide it by 5 to get 24
- 4! = 24 ‚û°Ô∏è divide it by 4 to get 6
- 3! = 6 ‚û°Ô∏è divide it by 3 to get 2
- 2! = 2 ‚û°Ô∏è divide it by 2 to get 1
- 1! = 1 ‚û°Ô∏è divide it by 1 to get 1
- 0! = 1 
```

- Consider a cricket team with 11 players
- How many batting orders are possible?

- What if we had 2 players ?
    - Answer : 2 (2!)
	- AB or BA

- What if we had 3 players ?
	- Answer : 6 (3!)
	- ABC, ACB, BAC, BCA, CAB, CBA

- Now go for 11 players
	- Answer : 39916800
	- 11! = 11 * 10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 39916800

# Introduction To Matrices

- Collection of numbers arranged in rows and columns

| A   | 3 Columns |     |     |        |
| --- | --------- | --- | --- | ------ |
| ‚¨áÔ∏è  | ‚¨áÔ∏è        | ‚¨áÔ∏è  |     |        |
| -2  | 5         | 6   | ‚¨ÖÔ∏è  | 2 Rows |
| 5   | 2         | 7   | ‚¨ÖÔ∏è  |        |

- A matrix with 2 rows and 3 columns is called a 2x3 matrix
- Ai,j = ?
	- i = row number
	- j = column number

A2,3 = ?
	- 2nd row
	- 3rd column
	- 7

Where is the 5 located?
	- 1st row
	- 2nd column

- Column Matrix
	- A matrix with 1 column
	- Example: 
```math
\matrix{A} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 \\ 2 \\ 3 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}
```
- Row Matrix
	- A matrix with 1 row
	- Example: 
```math
\matrix{A} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4 \end{bmatrix}
```
# Adding Matrices

- Rows indicate individual students ( 3 students )
- Columns indicate individual exams ( 2 subjects )
- Matrix as an exam result table:
```math
\matrix{Midterm+Final} = \begin{bmatrix} 40 & 36 \\ 28 & 32 \\ 30 & 27 \end{bmatrix}+ \begin{bmatrix} 19 & 35 \\ 48 & 12 \\ 33 & 48 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 59 & 71 \\ 76 & 44 \\ 63 & 75 \end{bmatrix}
```
# Power And Roots

```math
Power: b^x
```
- Base and exponent

```math
b^x = b * b * b * b *...* b (x times)
```
```math
5^3 = 5 * 5 * 5 = 125
```
Root:(nth root of a)
```math
Root: n\sqrt{a} 
```
- Assume: n‚àöa = x
- Then: x^n = a

```math
2\sqrt{16} = 4
```
```math
4^2 = 16
```
# Introduction To Sets

- A set is a collection of objects
   - No specific order or index
- Objects in a set are called elements
- Example: 
	- Natual number set: { 1, 2, 3, ...}   ‚û°Ô∏è Infinite set
	- Name of favorite sports: { Cricket, Football, Tennis } ‚û°Ô∏è Finite set

# Intro To Sets

- Subset
	- A is a subset of B if all elements of A are also in B
	- A = {10, 12, 29} and B = { 101, 12, 10, 29, 32 }

- Universal Set
	- When taking about numbers, universal set might be the set of Real Numbers
	- In case of set of favorite sports, universal set might be the set of all sports

- Empty / Null Set
	- A set with no elements
	- Example: { } or ‚àÖ

- U = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 }
- A = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 7 }
- B = { 3, 4, 5, 6 }
- C = { 4, 6, 7, 8, 9 }

- Three Set operations:
	- Union ‚û°Ô∏è ( A ‚à™ B ) = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 }
	- Intersection ‚û°Ô∏è ( A ‚à© B ) = { 3, 4 }
	- Complement ‚û°Ô∏è ( A' ) = U - A = { 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 }

# Point

- A point is a location in space
- Just a dot
- Location only
- No lenght, width, shape, size

```mermaid
%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'drak', 'gitGraph': {'showBranches': true, 'showCommitLabel':true,'mainBranchName': 'Point'}} }%%
      gitGraph
        
        commit id:"This is a point"
```
# Line

- A line is a set of points
- Connect them
- Take the straight path
	- Also the shortest path
- This is called line segment

```mermaid
%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'drak', 'gitGraph': {'showBranches': true, 'showCommitLabel':true,'mainBranchName': 'Segment'}} }%%
      gitGraph
        
        commit id:"1"
		commit id:"2"
```
- This is called line segment
    - Finite length

- Line : extended in both ends
    - Infinite length

 ```math
 <‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ‚îÅ>
 ```

- Ray : extended in one end
	- Infinite length

# Coordinate Systems

- One Dimensional Coordinate System

+3 is located at the right
0 is located at the center
-3 is located at the left

```mermaid
%%{init: { 'logLevel': 'debug', 'theme': 'drak', 'gitGraph': {'showBranches': true, 'showCommitLabel':true,'mainBranchName': 'Number Line'}} }%%
      gitGraph
        
        commit id:"-3"
        commit id:"-2"
         commit id:"-1"
          commit type: HIGHLIGHT id:"0"
           commit id:"+1"
            commit id:"+2"
             commit id:"+3"
        
```
In one dimensional coordinate system, we can only move in one direction. We can only move left or right. We can't move up or down.

You deposit 5400Tk and got bank an amount of 6000Tk after 2 years. Find the simple interest rate of the bank.
```
- Solution

```math
I = P * n * r
```
```math
I = 5400 * 2 * r
```
```math
6000 = 5400 * 2 * r
```
```math
6000 = 10800 * r
```
```math
r = 6000/10800 = 5.55%
```
- Compound Interest

```math
A = P * (1 + r)^n
```
```math
After n years, the amount of money you have = Principal Amount * (1 + Interest Rate)^n
```

# Mean & Median

- Mean is the average of a set of numbers. It is calculated by adding all the numbers and dividing the sum by the total number of numbers in the set.

Mean Formula

```math
\overline{x}= \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_{i}
```
- x is the set of numbers
- n is the total number of numbers in the set
- i is the position of the number in the set
- Summation means adding all the numbers in the set

You and your friends went to a restaurant. Everyone puts their money on the table and order the same meal for all within budget. How much is the maximum badget for each person?
- Money collected from 6 friends 103, 210, 57, 85, 500, 180
```
**- Solution**

```math
Everyone has a budget of at most the average amount = (103 + 210 + 57 + 85 + 500 + 180)/6 = 189.167
```
- Median is the middle number in a set of numbers.
  If count of numbers is odd, then the middle number is the median.
  If count of numbers is even, then the median is the average of the two middle numbers.

# Probability

- Probability is a number to indicate the change or likelihood of a particular event.
- Event: outcome of an experiment or process

```
- The number is between 0 and 1
	- 0 means the event is impossible
	- 1 means the event is certain
```
```math
P(event) = /frac{Number of ways it can happen}{Number of all possible outcomes}
```
