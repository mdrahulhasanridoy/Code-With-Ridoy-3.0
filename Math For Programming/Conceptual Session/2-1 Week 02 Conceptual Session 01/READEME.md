```
 There is bamboo in the forest. That's 92 feet. Also, there is a monkey in the forest. It can climb m feet in every first minute. But, it goes down n feet in every second minute. How many minutes will it take to climb the bamboo? ( h = 92, m = 12⬆️, n = 8⬇️ )
```

```math
\begin{align}
\text{Time} &= \frac{\text{h} - \text{m}}{\frac{\text{m} - \text{n}}{2}} + 1 \\
&= \frac{92 - 12}{\frac{12 - 8}{2}} + 1 \\
&= \frac{80}{2} + 1 \\
&= 41
\end{align}
```
